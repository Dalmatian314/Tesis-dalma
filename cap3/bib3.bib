We found that the responsivity to the photoillumination depends on the transistor's channel length and that it can be tuned by varying the device geometry. The analysis of different morphologies of the active semiconducting layer revealed that single PDI fibers exhibit the higher photoresponse when compared to more poorly organized films. The highest responsivity value of 4.08 ± 1.65 × 10(5) A/W was achieved on a multifiber-based OPT. These findings represent a step forward toward the use of organic based phototransistors as photosensors.},

Spheres and spheroids of varying aspect ratios as well as a number of polyhedral particle shapes are studied. The frequency of the maximum absorption is found to scale linearly with the surface to volume ratio of the particle with a slope and intercept, which depends on particle shape, in particular, on the deviation from sphericity. In the case of spheroids, the shifts of the two different plasmon peaks that are observed are characterized as a function of the aspect ratio. The influence of shape is seen to be a determining factor for the frequency of the plasmon resonance. The influence of adatoms is studied. Linear relations between surface adatom concentration and the width of the spectral feature as well as the peak energy are observed.},

We present calculated absorption spectra for a series of nanospheres of different radii and crystal structures. Our results show that bare TiO(2) nanoclusters have the same adsorption edge for direct electronic transition independently of the crystal structure and the nanocluster size. We report values of the adsorption edge of around 3.0 eV for all structures analyzed. In the present work we demonstrate that, for small clusters, both the direct transition absorption edge and the blue shifting phenomena are masked by thermal disorder.},

CD spectroscopic studies on dilute solutions revealed a preferential population of one-handed helical assemblies in chiral solvent with an enantiomeric excess close to 100 \%, whereas AFM images of more than 100 nanofibers of the organogel obtained from more concentrated solutions were found to consist of both handed helices with an enantiomeric excess of only 20 \%. This discrepancy is attributed to the fast gelation process at high dye concentration that evidently proceeds through non-equilibrated nuclei in a kinetic rather than thermodynamic self-assembly process. Under these conditions the chiral induction from the homochiral solvent may not be adequate in effectively populating only one-handed helices.},

@article{You2013,
abstract = {An effective way to improve polymer solar cell efficiency is to use a tandem structure, as a broader part of the spectrum of solar radiation is used and the thermalization loss of photon energy is minimized. In the past, the lack of high-performance low-bandgap polymers was the major limiting factor for achieving high-performance tandem solar cell. Here we report the development of a high-performance low bandgap polymer (bandgap <1.4 eV), poly[2,7-(5,5-bis-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyran)-alt-4,7-(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothia diazole)] with a bandgap of 1.38 eV, high mobility, deep highest occupied molecular orbital. As a result, a single-junction device shows high external quantum efficiency of >60{\%} and spectral response that extends to 900 nm, with a power conversion efficiency of 7.9{\%}. The polymer enables a solution processed tandem solar cell with certified 10.6{\%} power conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions (25 °C, 1,000 Wm(-2), IEC 60904-3 global), which is the first certified polymer solar cell efficiency over 10{\%}.},
